Hello there! This is another pet project of mine. It uses a two-dimensional array of characters to encrypt and decrypt texts. 

I like the idea that Java sees every String as an array of characters (which can be proven by String.charAt(i)). That's why I wanted to show every String can be indeed "built" out of characters.
I didn't want this project to be too simple and decided to include an encryption feature to this "building a String simulator". 

The programm has 2 main features: 
1) It encrypts a text given by a user and
2) it decrypts a text (provided it was decrypted the same way) into a normal English/German text (including umlauts)

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
